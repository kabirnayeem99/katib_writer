# Minimalistic Arabic Writer PWA

PWA designed to provide a simple and distraction-free platform for writing Arabic. Developed to address the lack of suitable free text editors for macOS and the issues with cursor movement in right-to-left (RTL) languages, I personally was facing. This app offers offline support and better RTL-language support.

## About

The code behind it can't get simpler, a text area with RTL-first support and a pleasing pastel color scheme, also some JavaScript functions to support English to Arabic typing, and local save feature.

## How to Use

1. Access the Minimalistic Arabic Writer PWA by visiting [minimalarabicwriter.tiiny.site](https://minimalarabicwriter.tiiny.site) in Chrome, Brave, or any PWA-supported browser.
2. Install the app if prompted, then access it from your app launcher, app menu, or Spotlight.

If you want, you can contribute, or you can fork, and add features.
